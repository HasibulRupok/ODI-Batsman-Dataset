# ODI Batsman Dataset ðŸŽ¯

This repository contains the **ODI Batsman Dataset**, a novel dataset that records almost every ball faced by **Virat Kohli** in One Day International (ODI) cricket matches.  
The dataset has been carefully compiled from multiple cricket commentary and video sources, making it one of the first ball-by-ball datasets of a single batsman in ODIs.

The dataset has been archived and assigned a DOI via **Zenodo**.
